# TODO: Improve Design and Add Animations to HomeScreen

- [x] Install react-native-reanimated for smooth animations
- [x] Run npm install after adding dependency
- [x] Update HomeScreen.tsx to add fade-in and slide-in animations on screen load (cancelled due to compatibility issues)
- [x] Enhance UI: Use LinearGradient for backgrounds, add icons to buttons, improve colors and shadows
- [ ] Test design improvements on device/simulator
- [x] Ensure compatibility with Expo (removed incompatible animation library)
